# New Languages

As tempting as it is for me to stay in the cocoon of duck-typing, readabilty and polymorphism that is Python, I want to know more than just one language.

This repository is for keeping track of my progress as I learn new languages. My goal is to start with simple "Hello world!" type scripts and then walk my way through the features of each language until I can create separate projects in each language.

So far, I have these languages in the repo:

 1. C++
 2. Java
 3. JavaScript
 4. Go
 5. Rust
